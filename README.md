# TimeSeriesClassification
This repository is created for experiments on time series classification. 

Modifications made on the traditional Transformer model used for NLP. 




Traditional transformer models get a sequence as input and I take the advantage of this sequence input.


You can find hyper parameters in model_summary.py file. 
The output for model summary is represented below.
